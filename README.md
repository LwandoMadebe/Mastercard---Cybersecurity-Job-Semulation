# Mastercard---Cybersecurity-Job-Semulation

### Task One

I was working as an analyst in the Mastercard Security Awareness Team, I played a crucial role in helping our staff at Mastercard learn how to identify and report security threats. One of the most common threats we face today is phishing.

Phishing is the act of pretending to be someone or something to obtain sensitive information, such as passwords. Attackers often send links or attachments designed to infect the recipient's system with malicious software or trick them into providing financial information, system credentials, or other sensitive data. Successful phishing attempts can cost companies like Mastercard millions of dollars and put our employees at risk. That’s why it’s vital to keep our business and staff safe from harm.

At Mastercard, we take proactive steps to mitigate phishing threats by educating our people about the risks and how to recognize them. One effective way we build awareness is through phishing simulation campaigns. Each month, we test our staff by sending a fake phishing email that mimics what a bad actor would send. We then analyze the results of these simulated tests to help design and implement future training.

By continuing to raise awareness and improve our security practices, we can better protect ourselves and our organization from these threats.

#### My Task

My task was to create a believable phishing email for Mastercard’s next phishing simulation campaign. This was an awesome opportunity for me to step up and show what I can do.
